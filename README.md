# SSUI-Homework-3

**Github Pages** (This one isn't working): http://afaucher.me/SSUI-Homework-3/ Currently having issues with Github Pages (I host my portfolio on this Github account and it seems to be conflicting with this assignment).

**Bitballoon** (This one works): http://robber-pig-18373.bitballoon.com/
I threw this up on Bitballoon, which will expire in a day or two. Site works as intended.

**Local** (This works too).
Site should run fine if run locally. There are some `XMLHttpRequests` to dynamically construct pages, so you'll likely hit console errors unless youre running a server locally. I usally use https://github.com/indexzero/http-server
