Note: Currently having issues with Github Pages (I host my portfolio on this Github account and it seems to be conflicting with this assignment).

Site should run fine locally. There are some `XMLHttpRequests` to dynamically construct pages, so you'll likely hit errors unless youre running a server locally. I usally use https://github.com/indexzero/http-server
